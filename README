NAME
    Test::Benchmark - Make sure something really is faster

SYNOPSIS
      use Test::More test => 17;
      use Test::Benchmark;

      is_faster(-10, sub {...}, sub {...}, "this is faster than that")
      is_faster(5, -10, sub {...}, sub {...}, "this is 5 times faster than that")
      is_n_times_faster(5, -10, sub {...}, sub {...}, "this is 5 times faster than that")

      is_faster(-10, $bench1, $bench2, "res1 was faster than res2");

            is_fastest("c", -1, {a => sub {...}, b => sub {...}, c => sub {...},);

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes you want to make sure that your "faster" algorithm really is
    faster than the old way. This lets you check. It might also be useful to
    check that your super whizzo XS or Inline::C version is actually faster.

    This module is based on the standard Benchmark module. If you have lots of
    timings to compare and you don't want to keep running the same benchmarks
    all the time, you can pass in a result object from "Benchmark::timethis()"
    instead of sub routine reference.

USAGE
    There are 3 functions exported: "is_faster()", "is_n_times_faster()" and
    "is_fastest()". Actually "is_faster()" is redundant because
    "is_n_times_faster()" can do the same thing just by setting n to 1.

    Anywhere you can pass a subroutine reference you can also pass in a
    Benchmark object.

      # call as
      # is_faster($times, $sub1, $sub2, $name)
      # is_faster($faster, $times, $sub1, $sub2, $name)

    If you leave the number of iterations blank then it will use Benchmark's
    default.

  is_faster()
    is_faster($times, $sub1, $sub2, $name)

    is_faster($factor, $times, $sub1, $sub2, $name)

    This runs each subroutine reference $times times and then compares the
    results. Instead of either subroutine reference you can pass in a Benchmark
    object. If you pass in 2 Benchmark objects then $times is irrelevant.

    If $times is negative then that specifies a minimum duration for the
    benchmark rather than a number of iterations (see Benchmark for more
    details). I strongly recommend you use this feature if you want your modules
    to still pass tests reliably on machines that are much faster than your own.
    10000 iterations may be enough for a reliable benchmark on your home PC but
    it be just a twinkling in the eye of somebody else's super computer.

    If the test fails, you will get a diagnostic output showing the benchmark
    results in the standard Benchmark format.

  is_n_times_faster()
    is_n_times_faster($factor, $times, $sub1, $sub2, $name)

    This is exactly the same as the second form of is_faster but it's just
    explicit about the "n times" part.

  is_fastest()
    is_fastest($bname, $times, $bhash, $name)

    This takes a hash reference containing benchmark subroutines as values and
    their names as keys. It times each subroutine and checks that the one named
    in $bname was the fastest. If the test fails, it will print out a sorted
    list of the timings of all the subroutines.

VARIABLES
    If you set "$Test::Benchmark::VERBOSE = 1" then the benchmark results will
    be printed out as diagnostics whether the tests pass or fail.

DANGERS
    Benchmarking can be slow so please consider leaving out the benchmark tests
    from your default test suite, perhaps only running them if the user has set
    a particular environment variable.

    Some benchmarks are inherently unreliable and should not be part of an
    automated test suite.

BUGS
    None that I know of but I said that last time too.

DEPENDENCIES
    Benchmark, Test::Builder but they come with most Perls.

HISTORY
    This came up on the perl-qa mailing list, when Jim Cromie wanted to display
    benchmark results in tests.
